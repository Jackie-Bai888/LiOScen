Role: You are an expert in the field of transportation. You need to convert the provided crash information into an OpenScenario script.
Task: Please generate an OpenScenario script based on the provided crash information by following these steps:
1. **Map Selection**:  
   Select an appropriate map from the provided map information based on **R** and the initial positions of vehicles **Vi** and **Vv**. If **R** represents an intersection, select a map that contains one or more intersections. If **R** does not represent an intersection and **Vi** and **Vv** are located on two adjacent lanes, then select a map that includes multiple lanes.
2. **Vehicle Mapping**:  
   Map **Vi** from the APS to the *ego* vehicle in OpenScenario, and map **Vv** to the *NPC*. If **Vv** does not appear in the **IB**, then the OpenSCENARIO script does not include an NPC vehicle.
3. **Route Definition**:  
   Based on **R**, the initial positions of **Vi** and **Vv**, and the **IB** in the APS, assign suitable routes for both the ego and the NPC within the selected map. First, determine a suitable route ER for the ego. Then, extract the first waypoint of this route ER as the starting position for the ego vehicle. Subsequently, choose the NPC route based on IB, and set its first waypoint as the starting position for the NPC. If **Vv** does not appear in the **IB** or is stationary, no route is assigned to the NPC vehicle. In addition, if Vv is stationary, the waypoint of the midpoint of the route should be selected as the starting position of NPC.
4. **Speed Configuration**:  
   Set the road speed limit **S** as the maximum speed for the npc. Additionally, configure the npc's speed according to the speed data of **Vv** provided in the APS. If S is null, set the maximum speed of the npc to 50. If the speed data of Vv is None, set the speed of the npc to 50. If **Vv** does not appear in the **IB**, the NPC's speed is not set.
5. **Traffic Light Handling**:  
   Based on the road structure **R**, determine whether traffic light information is required. If **R** indicates an intersection, extract the traffic light positions for the routes where **Vi** and **Vv** are located from the map data, and configure all relevant traffic lights to display a green signal at the start of the scenario.
6. **Pedestrian Placement (No Vv Case)**:  
   When **Vv** is absent in the **IB**, pedestrians need to be placed along the shoulder of **Vi**'s travel route. The number of pedestrians placed should be the same as the number of waypoints in the ego vehicle's route.
File Information: The OpenScenario script template file is File scenario_temp.txt, and the crash information file is File crash_info.txt. The map files are JSON files starting with "Town". The field "name" indicates the name of the map; "has_multi_lane_same_dir" indicates whether there are roads with multiple lanes in the same direction in the map; "has_intersection" indicates whether the map has intersections; "intersection_has_traffic_light" indicates whether the intersection has traffic lights; and "routes" represents multiple optional routes in the map. Each route contains the following: "id" (the unique identifier of the route), "is_intersection" (whether it is at an intersection), "is_multi_lane_same_dir" (whether it is on a road with multiple lanes in the same direction), "left_route_id" (the ID of the route to the left of this route), "right_route_id" (the ID of the route to the right of this route), "intersect_route_id" (the ID of the route intersecting with this route), "curvature" (the average curvature of this route), "traffic_light" (the position information of traffic lights on this route), and "waypoints" (all waypoints on this route).
Attention: You are instructed to not change the overall structure of the OpenScenario script, but instead perform the following modifications: replace the 'filepath' in the 'LogicFile' under 'RoadNetwork' with the selected map name, update the 'maxSpeed' of the NPC, modify the initial positions of both the ego and the NPC in the 'Init' section, and replace the 'Waypoint' in both the 'npcRoute' and the 'EgoPath' within the 'Story'. In the map, the first waypoint of each route serves as the starting point for both the ego and NPC vehicles, and the last waypoint serves as their destination. When setting the route for both the ego vehicle and NPCs, all waypoints of a route from the map must be included in the OpenScenario script, and the order of the waypoints in the OpenScenario script must match the order of the waypoints in the route on the map. However, when **R** is not an intersection, the ego vehicle's path only requires two points: the start and end. When selecting the ego route and NPC route in the map file, a correct corresponding relationship must be established. If the ego route and the NPC route are two routes at an intersection, the information in the intersect_route_id field included in the ego route within the map information should be identical to the ID value of the NPC route. If the **R** specified in the file 'crash_info.txt' indicates an intersection, then in the script file 'scenario_temp.txt', the numeric values in the 'name' field of the 'TrafficSignalStateAction' within the events "GreenEventEgo" and "GreenEventNPC" shall be sequentially replaced with the x and y coordinates of the traffic signals from the map file. Specifically, the traffic light in "GreenEventEgo" refers to the signal located along the route of the ego vehicle, while the traffic light in "GreenEventNPC" refers to the signal located along the route of the NPC vehicle. When the behavior of **Vi** in the **IB** is Proactive Trajectory Intrusion, the ego's route should be adjacent to the NPC's route and the last waypoint of the ego's route is replaced with the last waypoint of the NPC's route. In addition, do not change any attribute names or attribute values. If **Vv** does not appear in the **IB**, the pedestrian placement coordinates must be the coordinates of the shoulder on the route where ego is located. No other routes’ shoulder coordinates are allowed. If **Vv** does not appear in the **IB**, a route with a shoulder is preferably selected as the ego's driving path, and the orientation of the lane where Vi's initial position is located is not considered. In addition, If **Vv** does not appear in the **IB**, select a single-lane road (i.e., a route with `is_multi_lane_same_dir` set to `False`) as the ego's driving route.
