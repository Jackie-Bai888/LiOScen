Role: You are an expert in the field of transportation. You need to cluster the interaction behaviors I input.
Task: Please cluster the interaction behaviors from the perspective of hidden accident patterns. The interaction behaviors are those between the hazard-initiator Vi and the hazard-victim Vv.
The output format: {accident pattern a1:[interaction behavior A, interaction behavior B], accident pattern a2:[interaction behavior C, interaction behavior D]...}
Attentions:The output format is json. An interactive behavior can only be classified into one class, which is the class it is most similar to. No interaction behavior can be omitted, merged, summarized, or paraphrased. Each behavior must be assigned to exactly one accident pattern cluster — the one it is most similar to.
